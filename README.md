This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Future Features

Data Table

- Storing filter conditions state in query parameters (so that the table is still filtered upon refresh)

Chat

- Tag a User
- Emoji tooltip
- Commands suggestions pop up (I built out the command functionality but not the action pop up that shows the valid commands when a user types "/")
